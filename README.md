# JavaScript Learning Project

## Introduction

This project is designed to help you learn basic and advanced JavaScript concepts through practical examples, including sorting and searching algorithms. It covers fundamental JavaScript topics such as variables, functions, objects, arrays, loops, ES6 features, promises, and async/await.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files and directories:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the web page.
- **css/styles.css**: The CSS file for styling the HTML elements.
- **js/sorting.js**: Contains various sorting algorithm implementations.
- **js/searching.js**: Contains various searching algorithm implementations.
- **js/concepts.js**: Contains examples of basic and advanced JavaScript concepts.
- **js/main.js**: Contains the main logic for interacting with the HTML elements and invoking the sorting and searching functions.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Implementations of Linear Search and Binary Search.
- **JavaScript Concepts**: Examples demonstrating variables, data types, functions, objects, arrays, loops, ES6 features, promises, and async/await.


## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/javascript-learning-project.git
    cd javascript-learning-project
    ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your web browser** to explore the project.

## Features

### Sorting Algorithms

The project includes implementations of the following sorting algorithms:

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: An in-place comparison sort that divides the input list into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part, then repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part.
- **Insertion Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time, inserting each new item into its proper place.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **Quick Sort**: A highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a pivot element to partition the array into two halves, then recursively sorts the partitions.

### Searching Algorithms

The project includes implementations of the following searching algorithms:

- **Linear Search**: A straightforward search algorithm that checks each element of the list sequentially until the desired element is found or the list is exhausted.
- **Binary Search**: A highly efficient search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### JavaScript Concepts

The project covers the following JavaScript concepts:

- **Variables and Data Types**: Understanding different types of variables and data types in JavaScript.
- **Functions**: Defining and invoking functions.
- **Objects**: Creating and using objects.
- **Arrays**: Working with arrays and array methods.
- **Loops**: Using different types of loops to iterate over arrays.
- **ES6 Features**: Understanding modern JavaScript features like arrow functions, promises, and async/await.

## Usage

### Sorting and Searching

1. **Enter numbers**: Input a list of numbers separated by commas.
2. **Choose a sorting algorithm**: Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3. **Sort & Search**: Click the "Sort & Search" button to sort the array.
4. **Enter a number to search**: Input a number to search within the sorted array.
5. **Search**: Click the "Search" button to perform the search.

### JavaScript Concepts

The concepts are automatically displayed when you open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can view examples of basic and advanced JavaScript concepts along with explanations.
